# Status-Updates
12-Jan-2022 : JavaScript(Basics)
Concepts learnt:


callback- It is a function passed as an argument to another fuunction. Used for asynchronous functions(Functions running in parallel with other functions).


eventloop- Pulls stuff out of queue and plaes it onto the function execution stact whenever it becomes empty. Gives an illusion that JS is multithreaded even though it's single-threaded.


variable scopes- JS provides 3 scopes: a)Block scope b)Function/Local Scope c)Global scope
Varialbles can be local or global.


this- Refers to the object it belongs to.


Error handling- The try statement defines a code block to run (to try). The catch statement defines a code block to handle any error. The finally statement defines a code block to run regardless of the result. The throw statement defines a custom error.
(Implemented in the html file.)


Sample Queries:


What kind of Data Structure you can relate JS Object with?


Write down some of the IMPORTANT reserved keywords that you came across while exploring?
a)typeof - used to find the data type of the variable.
b)new - operator used to create an instance of an object. Eg: var employee = new Object();
c)if - if is used during conditional statements (if-else, if-else if)
d)var - used to declare/initialize variables.


If you follow the above links, you can see the use of the word ‘prototype’ what does it mean?
The prototype property allows you to add properties and methods to an object.
Syntax: object.prototype.name = value


Can you write some sample codes for all these concepts?
The sample codes for these concepts are in 'test.html' file.
